**Making the IR Array**

Here i make the IR Array. Here i used TCRT 500. Tcrt5000 is best for clean and smooth lines. So initially i will try with this rather than i will go with qtr-1rc this as well. And here i used 220ohm and 4.7k register it may vary on test case. firstly i will use 4.7k if this satisfy then it will be good to go other than i planned to use 10k
