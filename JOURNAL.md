Here i have made the line follower robot body in such a way so no need of any other chassis or something just install all the components and its ready to go. And there is a place to install battery in the back with zip tie

**Making the IR Array**

Here i make the IR Array. Here i used TCRT 500. Tcrt5000 is best for clean and smooth lines. So initially i will try with this rather than i will go with qtr-1rc this as well. And here i used 220ohm and 4.7k register it may vary on test case. firstly i will use 4.7k if this satisfy then it will be good to go other than i planned to use 10k

**Planning And Looks**

Initially i planned how it will be looks like. i want to build that in such a way to it being fast even capable to solve any pattern even bridge and cave as well.
